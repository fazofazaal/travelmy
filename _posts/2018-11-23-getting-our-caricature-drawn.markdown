The streets of Penang is a diverse place. On our second day while we were strolling around George Town, we came across this artist duo on Armenian Street. They immediately garnered our attention to their work. A young family of 4 western tourists posed infront of one of them, their caricatures, being drawn on paper with remarkable affinity.

We commisioned an artwork of us as it become was apparent to us that this was not an opportunity to be missed. The artist, drew each of us separately yet when the results came, it was as if we were side by side. It took him just 10 minutes.

We were glad we did it. Sadly, we left the original artwork in the bus.
