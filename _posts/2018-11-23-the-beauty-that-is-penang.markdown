Penang–a world - famous exotic holiday destination–once known as Pulau Pinang or the "Betel Nut Island", listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2008, this virgin dreamland has no shortage of cultural sites and natural landscapes.

Penang is mostly referred to Penang Island, a separate island off the coast of the state of Penang in northern Malaysia. It is about 355 km from Kuala Lumpura and takes 4 hours to reach by car.

Penang's urban landscape is defined by it's colonial era buildings and artifacts. It looks as urbanised as Kuala Lumpur yet you'll get a feeling of being travelled back in time to the early 19th century. It's amazing how Penangites have preserved it's heritage sites, unlike the reconstructions you'd observe in Kuala Lumpur.

Penag summarises the gastronomic story of Malaysia within once city which is George Town. It's most famous tourist spot.

Religion is aso a big part of Penang. From beautiful mosques and churches to intricate hindu and buddhist temples, Penang is splattered with religious sites.
