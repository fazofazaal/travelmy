Melaka is one of the most beautiful and unique places in Malaysia. Sometimes dubbed "The Historic State", is a state in Malaysia located in the southern region of the Malay Peninsula, next to the Strait of Malacca. It's capital city is called Melaka City. I visited Melaka on a one-day trip in late 2017, with 3 of my friends.

### The travels
Our bus to Melaka departed from Terminal Bersepadu Selatan in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 09:00 am in the morning and arrived at Melaka Sentral, Melaka City at 11:00 am. We travelled a 135 km to reach the city. The journey was quite pleasant. Our bus provider was K.K.K.L. Sdn. Bhd. Their bus was very comfortable with semi-sleeper chairs and airconditioning. We spend the two hours watching series and sightseeing throughout the journey. We were welcomed to Melaka with heavy rain. In Malaysia, it's not a surprising thing to get sudden rain showers and you could almost always expect for it to go away in a couple of hours.
